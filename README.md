# RustApi
Rust game server extension to provide **JSON Web API**.
It will made possible to grant access with permissions to particular plugins methods or to execute any hooks via web request.

With this **Web API** anyone can create own external applications (web, mobile, etc.) and use server plugins as a backend or just retrieve any information from server. 

You can use any external services more safety, cause now they haven't full access to server like with RCON connection.

# Status
In development.

# Do you have ideas?
Let write them in issues, and think together (;
